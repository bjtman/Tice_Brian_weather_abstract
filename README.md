# Sonic Weather Project

This project uses the darksky API to get realtime weather data for Boston and use it to seed audio effects. For example, the wind direction is mapped to the pan of the track, thus coupling the listener to their environment in new ways. Similarly, the temperature and wind speed map to reverb and delay effects respectively.
